    <p>
      This introductory meeting is a chance to meet other members of the
      Green Party Society, learn about what we do, and get involved in
      discussions around climate justice, sustainability, and student politics.
    </p>

    <p>
      No prior political experience is needed — everyone is welcome,
      whether you're just curious or already active in campaigning.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ll also outline upcoming events for the semester and ways to
      get involved.
