    <p>
      The University of Leicester Green Party Society is a student-led group
      for those interested in environmental justice, social equality, and
      progressive political change.
    </p>
    <p>
      We provide a space for students to discuss Green values, learn about
      political and environmental issues, and take part in campaigns and
      activities both on campus and beyond and around Leicester.
    </p>

    <h2>Our place in the wider Green movement</h2>

    <p>
      We are affiliated with the Young Greens, the youth and student branch of the Green Party of England and Wales, which exists to empower young people to engage with politics and shape a more sustainable and just future.
      As a university society, our focus is on creating an accessible space for students to learn about political issues, share ideas, develop confidence, and take part in meaningful discussion and action, regardless of prior political experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our society works independently while maintaining links with local and
      national Green Party groups, guest speakers, and campaigns.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Host talks, discussions, and workshops</li>
      <li>Organise social and campaigning events</li>
      <li>Promote environmental and political awareness on campus</li>
      <li>Create a welcoming space for debate and learning</li>
    </ul>

      need to be a Green Party member to take part.
