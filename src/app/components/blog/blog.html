        <h3>Why Students Should Care About Local Climate Policy</h3>
        <p class="blog-meta">

          Climate change can feel distant or abstract, but local policy decisions
          have real and immediate effects on our communities. From transport to
          housing, students have more influence than we often realise.

          Our first meeting of the year was relaxed, welcoming, and full of
          thoughtful discussion. It was great to see people from different
          backgrounds sharing ideas and questions.

          We’re often told that personal lifestyle choices are the key to solving
          environmental problems — but is that really enough? This post explores
          why collective action and systemic change matter.

        <h3>Being Politically Curious Without Being an Expert</h3>

          You don’t need to know everything about politics to get involved.
          Curiosity, openness, and willingness to listen are often more important
          than having all the answers.
