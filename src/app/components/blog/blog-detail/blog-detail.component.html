      Climate change is often framed as a global issue, but many of the
      most impactful decisions are made locally — by councils, universities,
      and community organisations.

    <p>
      For students, local climate policy affects housing standards, transport
      options, energy use on campus, and access to green spaces.

    <p>
      Engaging locally is often more accessible than national politics,
      and collective student voices can have real influence.

      Getting involved doesn’t require expertise — just curiosity,
      openness, and willingness to act together.
